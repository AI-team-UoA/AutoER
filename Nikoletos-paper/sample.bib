abstract = {Entity matching (EM), also known as entity resolution, fuzzy join, and record linkage, refers to the process of identifying records corresponding to the same real-world entities from different data sources. It is an important and long-standing problem in data integration and data mining. So far progresses have been made mainly in the form of model improvements, where models with better accuracy are developed when large amounts of training data is available. In real-world applications we find that advanced approaches can often require too many labeled examples that is expensive to obtain, which has become a key obstacle to wider adoption. We in this work take a different tack, proposing a transfer-learning approach to EM, leveraging pre-trained EM models from large-scale, production knowledge bases (KB). Specifically, for each entity-type in KB, (e.g., location, organization, people, etc.), we use rich synonymous names of known entities in the KB as training data, to pre-train type-detection and EM models for each type, using a novel hierarchical neural network architecture we develop. Given a new EM task, with little or no training data, we can either fine-tune or directly leverage pre-trained EM models, to build end-to-end, high-quality EM systems. Experiments on a variety of real EM tasks suggest that the pre-trained approach is effective and outperforms existing EM methods.1.},

    The paper studies the application of automated machine learning (AutoML) approaches for addressing the problem of Entity Matching (EM). This would make the existing, highly effective, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning based approaches for EM usable also by non-expert users, who do not have the expertise to train and tune such complex systems. Our experiments show that the direct application of AutoML systems to this scenario does not provide high quality results. To address this issue, we introduce a new component, the EM adapter, to be pipelined with standard AutoML systems, that preprocesses the EM datasets to make them usable by automated approaches. The experimental evaluation shows that our proposal obtains the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art EM systems, but it does not require any skill on ML to tune it.

abstract = {Entity matching (EM) finds data instances that refer to the same real-world entity. In this paper we examine applying deep learning (DL) to EM, to understand DL's benefits and limitations. We review many DL solutions that have been developed for related matching tasks in text processing (e.g., entity linking, textual entailment, etc.). We categorize these solutions and define a space of DL solutions for EM, as embodied by four solutions with varying representational power: SIF, RNN, Attention, and Hybrid. Next, we investigate the types of EM problems for which DL can be helpful. We consider three such problem types, which match structured data instances, textual instances, and dirty instances, respectively. We empirically compare the above four DL solutions with Magellan, a state-of-the-art learning-based EM solution. The results show that DL does not outperform current solutions on structured EM, but it can significantly outperform them on textual and dirty EM. For practitioners, this suggests that they should seriously consider using DL for textual and dirty EM problems. Finally, we analyze DL's performance and discuss future research directions.},
